# xmas3
Shows an xmas tree with snowflakes, animated using plain ascii characters

Legacy Borland Turbo Pascal program from the early nineties (of the last century :-), which was designed to run on a legacy IBM Personal Computer XT/AT.
The very first version, dating bak into the late eightees, was even written to work with a Qume Terminal connected over a serial interface.
It shows a Christmas Tree among falling snowflakes.

Revived by compiling it using free-pascal (www.freepascal.org⁠).
Amazingly, the ancient Turbo Pascal program turned out to be still flawlessly compileable without any changes and would run on an up-to-date notebook running Ubuntu 24.04!

So I thought I should publicly share my experience. Enjoy!

There is also a preproduced docker image ready to run, checkout https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/fraf1902/xmas3.<br/>
Alternatively, build your own container with the Dockerfile provided to run xmas3.pas on your hw/sw environment.

Have fun!
